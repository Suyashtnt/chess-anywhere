# chess-anywhere

## Global Chess games

Are you on Discord, but your friend really wants to play a game of chess on Minecraft?
Well no fear, because chess-anywhere is here!

This is the most cursed project idea I've had in a while.

## Platforms

- [ ] Discord (bot)
- [ ] Minecraft (possibly interact with https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/table-top-craft-fabric)
- [ ] Slack (bot)
- [ ] Web (chess.wobbl.in)
- [ ] Lichess (bot; requires timers to be implemented first. This could also be used to get the players initial ELO if it's the first game they've played)
